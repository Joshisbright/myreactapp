I need help completing a "Contact Us" page for my website, admaiora.online, which I’ve built on Replit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is the content I want to include. Please help me:

1. Create or update the `contact.html` file with this content, structured logically with a navigation bar, contact form, contact info, service promise, and footer.
2. Update the CSS (in `styles.css`) to make all fonts on the Contact page black for vivid visibility, using the Poppins font (already included via Google Fonts) and #6B2D5C purple accents for buttons and navigation.
3. Remove the FAQ section from the entire website (e.g., from navigation and footer links across all pages).
4. Add JavaScript (in `scripts.js`) to ensure that whenever a page is clicked or redirected (e.g., to About Us, Services, or Contact), it refreshes and scrolls to the top.

Here’s the content for the Contact Us page:
